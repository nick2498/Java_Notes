# What is Java?
- Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

# Primary/Main Features of Java:
1. Platform Independent
2. OOP Language
- Four main concepts of OOP are:
+ Abstraction + Encapsulation + Inheritance + Polymorphism
3. Simple
4. Robust
5. Secure
6. Distributed
7. Multithreading
8. Portable
9. High Performance
10. Dynamic flexibility
11. Sandbox Execution
12. Write once run anywhere
13. Power of compilation and interpretation

# Java Basic Syntax:
- A Java program is a collection of objects, and these objects communicate through method calls to each other to work together. Here is a brief discussion on the Classes and Objects, Method, Instance variables, syntax, and semantics of Java.

# Basic terminologies in Java:
1. Class: The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of a class (object). It can be defined as a template which describes the data and behaviour associated with its instance.
Example: Blueprint of the house is class.

2. Object: The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity which has behaviour and state.
Example: A car is an object whose states are: brand, colour, number-plate.
Behaviour: Running on the road.

3. Method: The behaviour of an object is the method.
Example: The fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car.

4. Instance variables: Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.
Example: Steps to compile and run a java program in a console
         javac GFG.java
         java GFG
